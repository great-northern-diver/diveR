Description: A suite of 'loon' related packages providing data analytic tools for 
    Direct Interactive Visual Exploration in R ('diveR').
    These tools work with and complement those of the 'tidyverse' suite, 
    extending the grammar of 'ggplot2' to become a grammar of interactive
    graphics.
    The suite provides many visual tools designed for moderately (100s of variables)
    high dimensional data analysis, through 'zenplots' and novel tools in 'loon', and
    extends the 'ggplot2' grammar to provide parallel coordinates, Andrews plots, and arbitrary 
    glyphs through 'ggmulti'.
    The  'diveR' package gathers together and installs all these related packages
    in a single step.
