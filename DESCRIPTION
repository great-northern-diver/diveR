Description: The `diveR` package is the `looniverse` of 
    `loon` related packages -
    the great northern `diveR` being another name (chiefly British) 
    for the Common `loon` (chiefly North American).
    Together the `diveR` suite provides data analytic tools for 
    Direct Interactive Visual Exploration in R.
    These tools work with and complement those of the `tidyverse` suite, 
    completing the graphics grammar of `ggplot2` to provide a grammar of interactive
    graphics.
    The suite provides many visual tools designed for moderately (100s of variables)
    high dimensional data analysis, through `zenplots` and novel tools in `loon`, and
    extends the `ggplot2` grammar to provide parallel coordinates, Andrews plots, and arbitrary 
    glyphs through `ggmulti`.
    The  `diveR` package gathers together and installs all these related packages.
